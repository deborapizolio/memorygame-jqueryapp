## Usage

To start the game, simply click on the "Start Game" button. This will shuffle and present a series of colored boxes. Click on two boxes to reveal their colors:

- If the colors match, both boxes will remain open.
- If the colors do not match, try to remember their positions and colors as they close again.

The goal is to match all pairs of colors with the fewest clicks possible. The game tracks the number of clicks you make, displaying your score at the end.
